This map was created to map out the chemical facilites located in the Delmarva region of the United States. This area consists of Maryland, Delaware, Virigna and the District of Columbia. The Enviornmental Protection Agency monitors and rates these sites to help them improve on their saftey. Regulation checks should be done on a regular basis, but are not always recorded. This map helps to show which facilites should be improved and montiored more to improve thier saftey. The map consists of industrial symbols that show the map, with a corisponding colors showing thier rating and its title. The map polygons help to show the density of sites in that area, which could be compared to the points for futher analysis. The spreadsheet provided has tons of useful information about the facilites and when they were last inspected, provided by the EPA.
